# 🎬 Video 5A — How Machines Share DNA (C++ Inheritance Basics)

Welcome to Video 5A in the **C++ Groundbreaking Roadmap for Embedded Systems**.

In this episode, we step beyond isolated modules and introduce **inheritance** — a fundamental building block for scalable and intelligent system design. Whether you're working on a drone, a robotic arm, or a medical monitoring system, inheritance lets you write **cleaner, reusable code** that reflects how real-world components share behaviors.

## What You’ll Learn

The **problem** with repetitive code in complex systems  
What inheritance really is — explained in the language of machines  
How to define a **base class** with shared logic and protected members  
How to use `virtual` functions to unlock flexible, override-ready design  
Why inheritance is like giving components shared DNA — safely and intentionally

---

## Real-World Metaphor

Think of your system like a machine family:
- Every sensor has shared capabilities (like calibrate, display).
- But each one may behave slightly differently.

Inheritance allows you to build that hierarchy **without duplication** — with clarity, structure, and safety.

---

## Code Summary

We introduced a base class `Sensor`:

```cpp
class Sensor {
protected:
    string sensorID;
    float value;

public:
    Sensor(string id) {
        sensorID = id;
        value = 0.0;
    }

    void calibrate() {
        value -= 0.5;
    }

    virtual void display() {
        cout << sensorID << ": " << value << endl;
    }
};
```

And we’ll use this base in future videos to create smarter, more flexible modules.

## 💡 Why It Matters in Embedded Systems

- Avoids duplicate logic across sensor/motor classes  
- Makes updates scalable and easier to maintain  
- Reflects how real machines evolve — **with shared blueprints and specialized behavior**

---

## 🔭 What’s Next

In **Video 5B**, we explore how **constructors and destructors** behave with inheritance:  
- What order they run in  
- How to safely initialize complex embedded components  
- And how to protect your system from broken initialization
