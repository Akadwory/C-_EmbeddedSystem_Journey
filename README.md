# cpp-systems-journey

A step-by-step, professional roadmap to mastering C++ for real-world systems engineering, robotics, embedded development, and AI integration.

## About This Project

This is a complete C++ mastery journeyâ€”from core language fundamentals to advanced systems architecture, embedded programming, and cross-language AI robotics. Each phase is structured to simulate real industry workflows, culminating in full-stack robotics and embedded-AI projects using modern C++.

Whether you're starting from scratch or looking to deepen your systems-level expertise, this journey is designed to build a solid foundation and scale up to professional-grade implementation.

## Phases Overview

### Phase 0: Setup and Project Branding
- Configure environment (G++, CMake, VSCode)
- Create GitHub structure and logs
- Build and run a basic C++ program

### Phase 1: C++ Fundamentals
- Syntax, types, memory, control flow
- CLI calculator, memory visualizer

### Phase 2: Object-Oriented Programming and STL
- Classes, inheritance, RAII, templates
- Custom vector, cache system, STL usage

### Phase 3: Algorithms and Data Structures
- Leetcode-style problem solving
- Trees, graphs, sorting, dynamic programming, recursion
- Real-world simulation: routing and planning logic

### Phase 4: Embedded Systems and Real-Time C++
- Interrupts, timers, I2C/SPI/UART, RTOS
- Embedded driver simulation, schedulers

### Phase 5: Systems Engineering Projects
- Telemetry decoder, drone control loop, sensor fusion
- Signal pipeline, real-time logger system

### Phase 6A: Systems Design and Interview Preparation
- Threads, mutexes, design patterns
- Unit testing with GTest
- Mock interviews and performance tuning

### Phase 6B: Python and C++ AI/Robotics Integration
- pybind11, LibTorch, TensorRT
- C++ to Python pipelines for edge-AI robotics
- Model loading, sensor input, inference pipelines

### Phase 7: Capstone Autonomous System
- Build a real-time, full-stack autonomous platform
- Options: drone control, robotics arm, sensor fusion node, or telemetry logger
- Includes documentation, architecture diagrams, and optional recorded demos
